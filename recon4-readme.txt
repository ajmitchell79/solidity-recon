How to Use the Reconciliation Contract:
1. Deploy the Contract
Deploy the contract to a local blockchain (e.g., using Remix, Ganache, or Hardhat).

Copy the contract address after deployment.

2. Submit Transaction Records
Bank A and Bank B submit their transaction records.

Each bank hashes its transaction data using a hash function (e.g., keccak256) before submitting it.

Example Data:

Bank A: Transaction Data: "Transfer of 5000 USD"

Bank B: Transaction Data: "Transfer of 5000 USD"

Generate Hashes:

In Remix or JavaScript, hash the data:

----------------------------
javascript

const recordA = web3.utils.keccak256("Transfer of 5000 USD");
const recordB = web3.utils.keccak256("Transfer of 5000 USD");
--------------------------------

Submit Records:

Bank A calls the submitRecord() function with recordA.

Bank B calls the submitRecord() function with recordB.

3. Retrieve Record IDs
Record IDs will be incremented automatically.

Check the record IDs by querying the recordCount variable.


Example:

Record 1: 0xabc123...

Record 2: 0xabc123...

4. Reconcile Records
Call the reconcileRecords() function with both record IDs.

----------------------------------------
Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
// Reconcile record 1 and record 2
contract.methods.reconcileRecords(1, 2).send({ from: adminAddress });
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the hashes match, the reconciled flag for both records is set to true.

If the hashes do not match, the contract emits a ReconciliationResult event with a false outcome.

✅ Expected Outcomes:
If both records match, the transaction is marked as reconciled and the flag is set to true.

If the records differ, a discrepancy is logged, and the flag remains false.

✅ Testing the Contract:
Deploy the contract on a testnet like Rinkeby, Goerli, or Sepolia.

Use ethers.js or web3.js to interact with the contract.

Verify transactions and logs using Etherscan or similar blockchain explorers.

✅ Enhancements:
Off-Chain Data Storage: Store raw transaction data off-chain (e.g., IPFS, Arweave) and only store the hash on-chain.

Multi-Party Reconciliation: Extend the contract to handle more than two parties.

Automated Dispute Resolution: Implement a voting mechanism to resolve discrepancies.

Timeouts: Add a time limit for reconciliation to prevent indefinite waiting.
